Assignment #10
 

 I had a ton of problems with the console portion of the project. I was able to eventually get working code, however nothing created by myself. The working code I was able to use and my code are more or less the same, so my code does look complete. I was unable to determine where the problem is. I will be continuing to work on this project, and hopefully will figure out what I did wrong shortly.
